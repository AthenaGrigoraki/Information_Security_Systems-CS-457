1. run `make` to compile
2. run `./split.out` and insert the password
!WATCH password must be  positive number (big as much as you want)
3. You will see in your screen the points of friends and the coefficients That
generated by dev/urandom
4.run `./join.out x1,f(x1)...x9,f(9)`
5. The order does not matter ! But be careful to parse the right numbers since
they are one too big
6. You will see the password diplayed

-------How it works---------
Split: a1-a8 coefficients are randoming created
We have made the assumption that sum of random numbers are random numbers
we did not made them too big but you can change this if you want more than 3digit
coefficients

Join: As in example tutorial you must place the tuples as parameters
for example if we have points is 1,f(1)=9213 2,f(2)=31 3,f(3)=3333
4,f(4)=4824 5,f(5)=43242 6,f(6)=803208 7,f(7)=37927 8,f(8)=329372
9,f(9)=392379

you must run `./join.out 1,9213 2,31 3,3333 4,4824 5,43242 6,803208 7,37927 8,329372 9,392379`


We exploited gauss Elimination, a common tactic code to find coefficients for polynomials
in C language
